>>  ## Notable Contributions
>>   ### 1. Bug Fixing
>>    - I playtested the game several times after completing each task to find any errors before moving on to the next task, so I wouldn’t encounter any related issues while working on other tasks.
>>    - In the end, I gathered feedback from various people to identify and fix unexpected bugs.
>>    - Whenever I found a bug, if it was my task, I handled it. If it was my teammate’s task, I informed him to fix it.
>>    - I created a 'Final Checklist' to quickly share bugs and small tasks with my teammate for polishing.
>>    - Finally, we completed the game with 0 errors!

>>   I found a bug where the fish would spawn randomly, but always on an ascending diagonal. It was hard to notice because the map was too large to show all the fish position, but sometimes when I saw two fish on the screen, they were always positioned like this: '/'. I checked the blueprint and discovered that the x and y values for fish spawning were set to the same random number. I informed my teammate (since Fish Spawning was his task) so he could fix it.

>>   ### 2. Convenient & Polished Shop System
>>    - I've implemented an auto-fish-selecting system in shop for convenient and satisfying user experience.
>>    - I switch menu fish-selling to upgrading when user sells all the fish.

>>   I thought some users might want to sell all their fish right away, and that it would feel satisfying to do so. So, I implemented an auto-fish-selecting system that automatically selects the next fish to sell from the top of the list after selling one.

> ## Cosmo Ranger
>> ### Description
>> - Genre: 3D Third-Person RPG Prototype (Unity, C#)
>> - Main repository: https://github.com/Manthan8567/Cosmo-Ranger (I worked as @sadoyh)
>> - Status: Complete (Duration: 3 months)
>> - Co-Contributors: @Manthan8567, @ocampo2001k
>> - This is a school project for my Game Engine class in the fourth semester. The theme was "main effect/side effect," so we created three different scenes: Tutorial, Sand Planet, and Mars. Each planet has a different effect and its corresponding side effect. Since this is a programming-focused class, our team concentrated on building a game with rich content and functionality rather than prioritizing visuals, ensuring everything was error-free within the given timeframe.
>> - As the team lead, I managed the project’s progression, quality, and teamwork, addressing any issues that arose. I also implemented various systems, including an enemy state machine, leveling system, quests, dialogue, animations for enemies and NPCs, item spawning, UI and more. Also, I modified and connected the system components to ensure they worked seamlessly across all three scenes. (For further details, I’ve outlined my contributions in the “Contributions” section below.)

>
>>  ## Notable Contributions
>>   ### 1. Integration of All Game Elements and Features
>>    - I modified and integrated the features to ensure they could be used across all the scenes and with other features.
>> 
>>   <br />
>>   <details>
>>   <summary>Example - Integration of Interation System    (Click to open)</summary>
>>
>>   We worked on different scenes to implement each task. Whenever my teammates finished and pushed their work, I tested it and integrated it to ensure the features could be used across all the scenes. For example, one of my teammates pushed the interaction system, which only worked with a vending machine. I modified the code structure so it could be used with all the other NPCs and game objects.
>>   </details>
>>
>>   <br />
>>
>>   ### 2. Problem Solving in Teamwork
>>    - We had some issues in teamwork.
>>    - As a team lead, I actively solve the problems through honest conversations.
>>    - As a result, my teammates became more active in communication, and we ended up with a final grade of 95/100.
>> 
>>   <br />
>>   <details>
>>   <summary>Example - When a teammate did not finish their task    (Click to open)</summary>
>>
>>   During the first three weeks, my teammates weren't as active or cooperative as I was. They often didn't respond to my messages and failed to complete the tasks assigned to them each week. So, I asked them to react (with a thumbs-up icon) to my messages, so I could at least know whether they had read them. I also encouraged them to share any struggles they were facing or let me know if they couldn't complete certain tasks, so we could help each other resolve the issues or adjust the plan accordingly. I knew I couldn't force them to work the way I do, but I felt it was important for all of us to stay on the same page and understand how the project was progressing. 
>>   </details>
>>
>>   <br />
>>
>>   ### 3. Bug Fixing & Polishing
>>    - I set the final testing date ahead of the actual presentation date.
>>    - We found some small bugs during the final test, and I fixed all of them while polishing the overall game.
>>    - Finally, we completed and presented our game with 0 significant errors.
>> 
>>   <br />
>>   <details>
>>   <summary>Example - Final Testing & Polishing   (Click to open)</summary>
>>
>>   I thought we should do the final test at least two days before presenting the project. I decided to polish the project for two days before submitting it because I was the one who knew most of the systems in our game. So, I asked my teammates to complete their final tasks by the testing day. During the final test, we found some small bugs, and I fixed all of them while polishing the overall game. As a result, we finally presented it with no significant errors.
